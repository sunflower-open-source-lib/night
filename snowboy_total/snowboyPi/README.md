# snowboyPi
## snowboy setup on raspberry pi
Start with a fresh install of Raspbian (Lite or Regular, this guide assumes Lite)
1) Update
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt-get -y auto-remove && sudo reboot
```
2) Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt -y install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio sox python3-pip python-pip libatlas-base-dev
```
3) Install PortAudio’s Python bindings:

**python2**
```python
sudo pip install pyaudio
```
**python3**
```python
sudo pip3 install pyaudio
```
4) Create **~/.asoundrc** with correct hw settings. use `aplay -l` & `arecord -l` to find out hw cards. "**card 0, device 0**" is "**hw:0,0**"
In the attached sample, playback is through onboard jack & input is through usb mic
5) If using RESTful API Calls via python script (per snowboy instructions) need to install "requests" module for python:
```
pip install requests
```
6) Download pre-packaged Snowboy binaries and their Python wrappers for Raspberry Pis:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/snowboy/snowboy-releases/rpi-arm-raspbian-8.0-1.1.1.tar.bz2
7) Extract to Pi & rename directory to "**snowboy**"
8) Use `speaker-test -c 2` to test audio out
9) Use `arecord -d 3 test.wav` to record a 3 second test clip. Use `aplay test.wav` to verify
10) If you need to tweak some alsa settings, use *alsamixer* & then run the following to keep the settings
```bash
sudo alsactl store
```

## Prepare Snowboy
1) copy **training_service.py** to the snowboy directory
2) log into https://snowboy.kitt.ai, click on “Profile settings”, and copy your API token
3) change the appropriate fields (token, hotword, etc.) in **training_service.py**
4) use the following to record 3 wav files of your hotword to the same directory
```
rec -r 16000 -c 1 -b 16 -e signed-integer FILENAME.wav
```
5) run the following to generate a pmdl
```
python training_service.py 1.wav 2.wav 3.wav saved_model.pmdl
```
6) move **saved_model.pmdl** to **~/snowboy/resources/** (rename for easier recall later)
7) run the demo to make sure everything is working:
```
python demo.py ~/snowboy/resources/saved_model.pmdl
```

## Customize Snowboy
1) copy **snowboy.py** to the snowboy directory
2) copy the curl requeset from thinger.io to **~/thingeriocurl.sh** and make it executable. be sure to replace the "bearer" information with the static device token
3) run **snowboy.py** to make sure everything is working:
```
python snowboy.py
```

## Autostart Snowboy
1) copy **snowboy.service** to **/lib/systemd/system/**
2) you may need to run this:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
```
3) start the **snowboy.service** to make sure everything is working:
```
sudo systemctl start snowboy.service
```

## Adding
Use **training_service.py** to train more voice models and add pmdl files to **~/snowboy/snowboy.py** (comma separated)

## To Do
- [ ] incorporate **~/thingeriocurl.sh** into **~/snowboy/snowboy.py**
